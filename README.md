# WE-REMEMBER

Feel free to edit this Readme. This is a rough roadmap.

//Back=>
-To Dos:
-Set up a DB. (I think Postgres it's ok)
-Handle the validations for the submissions. (Just the basics for now. We should discuss more complexities later)
-Test


//Front=>
-Make sure what pages and components we'll render.
-Present rough designs
-List functionalities and ways to implement them.
